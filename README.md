# Simple React Graph
## About
This is a simple bar graph made in ReactJS as an experiment and for practice. It uses a modular structure, as is the norm for React, as well as Sass for an equivalently modular styling. Changing the numbers below the bars updates the bars accordingly, and the graph will adapt to the highest number.
## Installation
Nothing to install really, the source code is in the `app` folder, and the output files, that you can open in a browser, are in the `build` folder.
